What this project is about
==========================

This internal project is aiming to show the tremendous value of a well
written documentation. As the title suggests this is for the 
Argo-Prefect/pure Prefect projects.
Again this is just an example project the docs generation will be placed in a
CI/CD pipeline. But with this project everyone can experiment with the process
locally and you can see what you need to do to document your code for your
colleagues and clients.
